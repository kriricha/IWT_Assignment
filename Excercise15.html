		<h1>Introduction to CSS</h1>
		<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to specify the presentation, or styling,
		of elements on a web page (e.g., fonts, spacing, sizes, colors, positioning). CSS was
		designed to style portable web pages independently of their content and structure. By separating page styling from page content and structure, you can easily change the look and
		feel of the pages on an entire website, or a portion of a website, simply by swapping out
		one style sheet for another. CSS3 is the current version of CSS under development.
		Chapter 5 introduces many new features in CSS3</p>

		<h2>Layout</h2>
		<p>Finally, we style the p elementâ€”the text within each div (line 44). We specify a paragraph height of 250px and the 	overflow as hidden, which hides any text that does not fit
			in the specified paragraph height. In the output, notice that the text in the second child
			element (the Error-Prevention Tips), <span class = "highlight" >the overflow text is hidden. When the mouse hovers
			over the element, </span> all of the text is revealed. We also specify the Google font "Rosario",
			which we embedded in our style sheet (lines 9-10).</p>
